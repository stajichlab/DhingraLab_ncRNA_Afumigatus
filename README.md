This repository archives the RNA-Seq analysis pipeline and the plotting tools. All read counts are archived in the repository [results folder](results) so the R-scripts are reproducible from the repository.

The RNA-seq read are available under BioProject [PRJNA1334547](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA1334547), SRA project accession [SRP627708](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SRP627708/), and with associated read counts under GEO accession [GSE309441](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/GEO/GSE309441).
