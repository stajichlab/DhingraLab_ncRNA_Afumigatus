# Azole and ncRNA in A.fumigatus

Work lead by the Dhingra Lab on Azole-induction of gene network and interactions with ncRNAs.
This repository archives the RNASeq analysis pipeline and the plotting tools. All read counts are 
available in the repository so the R-scripts are reproducible from the repository.

The RNA-seq read are available under BioProject [PRJNA1334547](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA1334547), SRA project accession [SRP627708](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SRP627708/), and with associated read counts under GEO accession [GSE309441](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/GEO/GSE309441).
